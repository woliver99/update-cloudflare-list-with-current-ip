# update-cloudflare-list-with-current-ip

Updates an IP list in Cloudflare with your current IP address

I know it doesn't support retaining IPs in the list or other types of IPs but I don't need those features.
If you need them, create an issue and I il take the time to update it, I'm not implementing it now since it is 4:38 AM and I want to go to bed

# API KEYS

The secrets config should generate on the first run

it seems that you need to use your global API key so fuck Cloudflare
