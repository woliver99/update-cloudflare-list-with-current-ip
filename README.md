# update-cloudflare-list-with-current-ip

Updates a ip list in cloudflare with your current ip address

I know it dosen't support retaining ip's in the list or other types of ip's but I don't need those features.
If you need them create a issue and il take the time to update it, im not implementing it now since its 4:38 AM and I want to go to bed

# API KEYS

The secrets config should generate on first run

it seems that you need to use your global api key so fuck cloudflare
